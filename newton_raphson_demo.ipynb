    "# Newton-Raphson implementation for a scalar equation\n",

    "\n",

    "#### Code example\n",
    "Below is an example of using the Newton-Raphson method to solve $x^2 - 4 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the following:\n",
    "* What is the purpose of the <code>maxiter</code> parameter?\n",
    "* What convergence criteria is this code using to terminate iterations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Try 'playing' with some of the following settings. How do they affect code performance or final solution?\n",
    "* Starting guess: are there any guesses that don't work well, or at all?\n",
    "* <code>tol</code> parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Try this\n",
    "\n",
    "Update the code to solve $f(x) = \\sin(x) - 1 = 0$. The exact solution is $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\pm 2\\pi n$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n",
    "* What should you consider when choosing the initial guess $x_0$? What initial guesses will cause problems for the algorithm?\n",
    "* Note the convergence rate for solving this equation compared to solving $x^2 -4 = 0$: Newton's method converges more slowly (linear vs quadratic) when the root $x^*$ also satisfies $f'(x^*) = 0$.\n"
